      content: Now you have to locate different stimuli. Play back a stimulus and place the spheres, with the colors of the buttons in the according box with the player, to the positions where you perceive sound sources. The number of spheres should fit the number of perceived sound sources and it is not important which sphere represents which sound source. Place the spheres simply by clicking into the scene
